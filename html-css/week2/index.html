                <h3>WEB DEVELOPMENT AS AN INDUSTRY</h3>
                <p> Example of dramatic transformation in communication and commerce led by web deb development include
                    e-com-merce. Online auction sites such as eBay have changed the way consumers find and purchase
                    goods and services. Online retailers such as Amazon.com and eBuy.com (among many others) have
                    transformed the shopping and bargain-hunting experience for many consumers.

                <h1>PRACTICAL WEB DEVELOPMENT</h1>
                <p> Since the commercialization of the web, web development has been a growing industry. The growth of
                    this industry is being driven by businesses wishing to use their website to sell products and
                    services tocustomers.[1]
                </p>

                <p> There is open source software for web development like BerkeleyDB, GlassFish, LAMP (Linux, Apache,
                    MySQL,PHP) stack and Perl/Plack. This has kept the cost of growth of the industry has been the rise
                    of easy-to-use WYSIWYG web web-development software, such as Adobe Dreamweaver, BlueGriffon and
                    Microsoft Visual Studio.Knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML) or of programming languages is
                    still required to use such software, but the basics can be learned and implemented quickly with the
                    help of help files, technical books, internet tutorials, or face-to-face training.
                </p>

                <p>An ever-growing set of tools and technologies have helped developers build more dynamic and
                    interactive websites. Further, web developers now help to deliver applications as web services which
                    were traditionally only available as applications on a desk-based computer. This has allowed for
                    many opportunities to decentralize information and media distribution. Examples can be seen with the
                    rise of cloud
                    services such as Adobe Creative Cloud, Dropbox and Google Docs.These web services allow users to
                    interact with
                    applications form many locations, instead of being tied to a specific workstation for their
                    application
                    environment.
