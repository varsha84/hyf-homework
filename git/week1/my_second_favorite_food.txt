we always assume that most of the north indian or punjabi curries use the same gravy base with the same technique 
and hence it must be easy to prepare. this has been one of the stereotypes, especially for the paneer based recipes or curries. 
perhaps even during my initial days of culinary learning, i use to make all the paneer curries but name it differently as per the occasion. but trust me, there are so many subtle variations and nuances that go to each and every punjabi curry which makes it unique and hence the unique names. for instance, in this recipe of butter paneer, the base is prepared with onion and tomato but is handled differently compared to matar paneer or kadai paneer. in addition, there is a generous amount of butter and fresh cream used which makes it mild sweet and spicy curry. moreover, the spice addition is minimal and hence it is appreciated all over the world and not just in india.
